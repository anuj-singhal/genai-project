System Prompt: "You are an AI assistant with broad knowledge."

Test Questions:
1. "Explain machine learning"
   → General explanation without document references

2. "Write a Python function for sorting"
   → Code generation without documents
C. Hybrid Mode (Re-upload documents)
System Prompt: "You are a business analyst with access to company documents."

Initial Knowledge: "We are a B2B SaaS company in the data integration space"

Test Questions:
1. "How does our 72% gross margin compare to industry standards?"

2. "Based on Q3 performance, what should we focus on?"
   → Should analyze our data AND provide strategic recommendations
🎯 Key Test Scenarios
1. Single Document Retrieval

✅ Employee policies questions
✅ Product pricing questions
✅ Financial metrics questions

2. Multi-Document Synthesis
"Given our 423 employees and $2,500 training budget per person, 
what percentage of Q3 revenue would cover all training?"

Expected: Should calculate $1,057,500 total training cost 
(423 × $2,500) = 2.3% of $45.7M revenue
3. Complex Analysis
"What are our unit economics based on the financial data?"

Expected: Should calculate:
- CAC: $8,500
- LTV: $125,000
- LTV/CAC: 14.7 (very healthy)
4. Edge Cases
"What is the recipe for chocolate cake?"

Expected: "No relevant information found in documents"
